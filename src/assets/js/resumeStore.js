export const careerSummary = [
  "I'm a Full-Stack Engineer with over 4 years of experience working with Front-End frameworks (React, Vue.js, Angular, ...) and developing REST APIs and data pipelines mostly with Django and Python. Although mobile development is not my area of expertise, I do have some knowledge of React Native as well including a portfolio of a couple of mobile apps. As a self-taught developer, I love to keep learning and challenging myself everyday. In the short term, I would like to take my consolidated React knowledge to the next level and also earn the AWS developer certification.",
  "In terms of languages, I have developed a high level of English over the last few years. Especially during my stay in Ireland and these last three years at Amazon and EY, thanks to the enriching international environment I've belonged to. Currently, I'm also learning French in my free time.",
  "My focus is always on further improving my coding and soft skills. Furthermore, I consider mentoring and team collaboration a must. I love to help and learn from my teammates so that everyone knows and follows best practices. Only by doing so, can we offer high quality services up to the most demanding clients' standard."
